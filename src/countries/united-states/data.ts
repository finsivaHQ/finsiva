Importantly, you do not pay the highest rate on all your income — only the portion that falls within each bracket is taxed at that rate. For example, if your taxable income puts you in the 22% bracket, only the income above the 22% threshold is taxed at 22%, while income below that threshold is taxed at the lower 10% or 12% rates."
